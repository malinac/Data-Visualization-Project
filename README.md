# Data-Visualization-Project

The last two years have been marked by the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, which has affected the lives of hundreds of millions of people, whether we talk about deaths, illness, quarantine or just a lifestyle change.
For one year after the pandemic broke out, scientists around the world have been working on several vaccines to fight the virus or its severe evolution in the body.
So, the world's population has been instructed to be vaccinated according to the specific scheme in order to eliminate the virus or reduce its consequences on humanity.

We aim to conduct an analysis on the data available from february 2021 to march 2022 in order to see how the countries have progressed in terms of vaccination rates through interesting plots.
